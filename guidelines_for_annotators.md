## annotation guidelines

**person:**

* in case name + function is mentioned, annotate name only
* add a name to `listperson.xml` in case a. first name and surname is provided, or b. surname and function is provided (thereby making the person unmistakable)  
* *Hansen*, *Josephen*, *Christophen* are annotated as *Hans*, *Joseph*, *Christoph*
* *Ännä Pirchnerin* is annotated as *pirchner_aennae*
* saints (*Johan*, *Franciscus*, *Mariä*) are not annotated
* in case a full name is separated by a page break (`<pb>`), annotate its second part only and leave the first one unannotated

**place:** 

* place names, e.g. in *Seckhlermaister zu Ratenberg*, are annotated
* in case a place name is mentioned as part of an organizational name, the place name is not annotated, e.g. *Salzburg* in *Erzbistumb Salzburg*, *Brixen* in *Stüffts Brixen*
